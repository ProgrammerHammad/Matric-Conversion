            <p>The proper format for scientific notation is a x 10^b where a is a number or decimal number such that the absolute value of a is greater than or equal to one and less than ten or, 1 ≤ |a| < 10. b is the power of 10 required so that the scientific notation is mathematically equivalent to the original number.To enter numbers in scientific notation, you can use the following format: Start with the base number or coefficient, which should be a decimal number between 1 and 10. Use the letter "E" or "e" to indicate the exponent. Specify the exponent, which represents the power of 10 by which the base number is multiplied.</p>
          <p class="example"><b>Example:</b></p>
          <p>650,000,000 can be written in scientific notation as 6.5 ✕ 10^8.</p>

            <p>What is a knot? What is a nautical mile?</p>

                <p>Knots and Nautical miles are good old navy terms. The nautical mile was based on the circumference of the earth at the equator. Since the earth is 360 degrees of longitude around, and degrees are broken into 60 so-called "minutes", that means there are 360 * 60 = 21,600 "minutes" of longitude around the earth. This was taken as the basis for the nautical mile; thus, by definition, 1 minute of longitude at the equator is equal to 1 nautical mile. So the earth is ideally, by definition, 21,600 nautical miles (and 21,600 "minutes" of longitude) in circumference at the equator. If anyone ever asks you how far is it around the earth, you can quickly do the math in your head (360 degrees * 60 minutes per degree) and answer "about 21,600 nautical miles!"</p>
          <p class="example"><b>Example:</b></p>
          <p> 60 NM represents 60 nautical miles. In addition to being used in navigation and aviation.</p>

            <p>It is true that rainfall fall is measured differently, but it all works out to just a plain old height measurement. But I know you would never be happy with the simple explanation, so then, let us work this problem out using our good friend, math.<br>

                Rainfall is measured by Volume over an Area. In algebra terms that is Volume/Area.<br>
                
                Volume = Length * Width * Height<br>
                Area = Length * Width<br>
                
                Now we know rainfall is measured by Volume/Area, we can substitute.<br>
                
                Volume/Area<br>
                (Length * Width) * Height / (Length * Width)<br></p>
          <p class="example"><b>Example:</b></p>
          <p>To convert inches to mm, you must multiply the unit by 25.4.</p>

    <summary>What is the difference between the long ton,short ton and metric ton?</summary>
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
    <p>The British ton is the long ton, which is 2240 pounds, and the U.S. ton is the short ton which is 2000 pounds.
    Both tons are actually defined in the same way. 1 ton is equal to 20 hundredweight. It is just the definition of the hundredweight that differs between countries. In the U.S. there are 100 pounds in the hundredweight, and in Britain there are 112 pounds in the hundredweight. This causes the actual weight of the ton to differ between countries.  To distinguish between the two tons, the smaller U.S. ton is called short, while the larger British ton is called long. There is also an third type of ton called the metric ton, equal to 1000 kilograms, or approximately 2204 pounds. The metric ton is officially called tonne. The SI standard calls it tonne, but the U.S. Government recommends calling it metric ton.</p>
    <p class="example"><b>Example:</b></p>
     <p>The tonne (/ton/ (listen) or /ton/; symbol: t) is a unit of mass equal to 1000 kilograms. It is a non-SI unit accepted for use with SI.[1] It is also referred to as a metric ton to distinguish it from the non-metric units of the short ton (United States customary units), and the long ton (British imperial units).[2][3] It is equivalent to approximately 2204.6 pounds,[4] 1.102 short tons, and 0.984 long tons. The official SI unit is the megagram (symbol: Mg), a less common way to express the same mass</p>

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
              <p>Celsius and Fahrenheit are two important temperature scales. The Fahrenheit scale is used primarily in the United States, while Celsius is used throughout the world. The two scales have different zero points and the Celsius degree is bigger than the Fahrenheit.<br>
              However, there is one point on the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales where the temperatures in degrees are equal. This is -40 °C and -40 °F</p>
