    <strong>How do I enter numbers in Scientific Notation?</strong>
    <p>To enter numbers in scientific notation, you can use the following format:

        Start with the base number or coefficient, which should be a decimal number between 1 and 10.
        Use the letter "E" or "e" to indicate the exponent.
        Specify the exponent, which represents the power of 10 by which the base number is multiplied.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong>
            Larger numbers:

            To represent 6.022 × 10^23, you can write 6.022e23.
            To represent 3.00 × 10^8, you can write 3.00e8.
            Smaller numbers:
            
            To represent 2.5 × 10^-3, you can write 2.5e-3.
            To represent 6.62607015 × 10^-34, you can write 6.62607015e-34.
              </p>
